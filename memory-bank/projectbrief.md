# NowPlayingTest Project Brief

## Project Overview

NowPlayingTest is a test project designed to implement and demonstrate a functional Now Playing widget in iOS using react-native-track-player. The project serves as a proof of concept and reference implementation for migrating the BalearicFmRadio app from expo-av to react-native-track-player.

## Core Requirements

1. **Implement Now Playing Widget**: Create a functional implementation of the iOS Now Playing widget that displays track information and allows playback control.

2. **Stream Playback**: Enable playback of a live audio stream with proper metadata handling.

3. **Background Playback**: Ensure audio continues playing when the app is in the background.

4. **Metadata Updates**: Implement real-time metadata updates for the Now Playing widget.

5. **Migration Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for migrating from expo-av to react-native-track-player.

## Project Goals

1. **Improve User Experience**: Enhance the audio playback experience with better system integration.

2. **Solve Technical Limitations**: Address the limitations of expo-av regarding Now Playing widget support.

3. **Create Migration Path**: Develop a clear migration strategy for the BalearicFmRadio app.

4. **Maintain Existing Functionality**: Ensure all current features continue to work after migration.

5. **Document Best Practices**: Capture learnings and best practices for future reference.

## Success Criteria

1. Now Playing widget appears and functions correctly on iOS devices.

2. Live stream plays with correct metadata displayed in the widget.

3. Playback controls (play, pause, stop) work from the widget.

4. Audio continues playing when the app is in the background.

5. Comprehensive migration documentation is created and verified.
