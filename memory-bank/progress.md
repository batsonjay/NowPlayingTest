# NowPlayingTest Progress

## Current Status

The NowPlayingTest project is currently in the **Documentation and Planning Phase**. The focus has been on creating comprehensive documentation for the migration from expo-av to react-native-track-player, setting up the repository, and preparing for the implementation phase.

### Status Summary

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Documentation | âœ… Complete | Comprehensive documentation created |
| Repository Setup | âœ… Complete | GitHub repository created and populated |
| Memory Bank | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Core files being created |
| Implementation | ðŸ“… Planned | Ready to begin implementation |
| Testing | ðŸ“… Planned | Will follow implementation |

## What Works

1. **Documentation**:
   - Migration plan with detailed implementation phases
   - Technical notes with implementation considerations
   - Developer setup instructions
   - Implementation best practices

2. **Repository**:
   - GitHub repository created: https://github.com/batsonjay/NowPlayingTest
   - Documentation files committed and pushed
   - Repository accessible for development on multiple computers

3. **Memory Bank**:
   - Core Memory Bank files created and populated
   - Project context and technical details documented

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Add TrackPlayer Dependencies

- [ ] Add react-native-track-player dependency
- [ ] Update iOS configuration
- [ ] Create new TrackPlayer files

### Phase 2: Implement Core TrackPlayer Functionality

- [ ] Create TrackPlayerContext
- [ ] Implement TrackPlayer Service
- [ ] Implement TrackPlayer Utilities

### Phase 3: Integrate Podcast Playback

- [ ] Add podcast playback to TrackPlayerUtils
- [ ] Update TrackPlayerContext with podcast functionality

### Phase 3.5: Implement UI-Focused Queue

- [ ] Implement queue state management
- [ ] Create queue utility functions
- [ ] Integrate queue with TrackPlayerContext

### Phase 4: Implement Compatibility Layer

- [ ] Create compatibility layer for backward compatibility
- [ ] Update components to use the new API

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement

- [ ] Test live stream playback
- [ ] Test podcast playback
- [ ] Test background playback
- [ ] Test edge cases

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Description | Estimated Time | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Add TrackPlayer Dependencies | 1 day | ðŸ“… Planned |
| 2 | Implement Core TrackPlayer Functionality | 2 days | ðŸ“… Planned |
| 3 | Integrate Podcast Playback | 1 day | ðŸ“… Planned |
| 3.5 | Implement UI-Focused Queue | 1 day | ðŸ“… Planned |
| 4 | Implement Compatibility Layer | 2 days | ðŸ“… Planned |
| 5 | Testing and Refinement | 2 days | ðŸ“… Planned |

Total estimated time: 9 days

## Known Issues

1. **Variable Name Conflicts in Compatibility Layer**:
   - Issue: Naming conflicts in the compatibility layer can cause infinite recursion
   - Solution: Rename imported functions to avoid conflicts
   - Status: âœ… Documented in MIGRATION_NOTES.md

2. **Missing Function Reference**:
   - Issue: Some function references in the code examples are missing or incorrect
   - Solution: Update function references to use the correct names
   - Status: âœ… Documented in MIGRATION_NOTES.md

3. **Missing DEFAULT_ARTWORK_URL Constant**:
   - Issue: The DEFAULT_ARTWORK_URL constant is used but not defined in the examples
   - Solution: Add the constant to types.ts
   - Status: âœ… Documented in MIGRATION_NOTES.md

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**:
   - Finish creating and populating all Memory Bank files
   - Commit and push Memory Bank to GitHub

2. **Prepare for Implementation**:
   - Set up development environment on the other computer
   - Clone the repository and install dependencies
   - Review the migration plan and notes

3. **Begin Implementation**:
   - Start with Phase 1: Add TrackPlayer Dependencies
   - Follow the implementation phases outlined in MIGRATION_PLAN.md
   - Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current Status |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Now Playing Widget | Functional | ðŸ“… Planned |
| Live Stream Playback | Functional | ðŸ“… Planned |
| Podcast Playback | Functional | ðŸ“… Planned |
| Background Playback | Functional | ðŸ“… Planned |
| Metadata Updates | Real-time | ðŸ“… Planned |
| Documentation | Complete | âœ… Complete |

## Blockers

Currently, there are no blockers preventing progress on the implementation. The documentation and planning phase has been completed, and the project is ready to move into the implementation phase.

## Achievements

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created detailed documentation for the migration process, including:
   - Migration plan with implementation phases
   - Technical notes and learnings
   - Developer setup instructions
   - Implementation considerations

2. **Repository Setup**: Set up a GitHub repository to store the project and documentation, making it accessible for development on multiple computers.

3. **Memory Bank Setup**: Created and populated Memory Bank files to preserve project context and knowledge.

4. **Migration Strategy**: Developed a clear migration strategy with a hybrid approach for naming, queue management, and metadata handling.
