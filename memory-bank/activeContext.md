# NowPlayingTest Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus of the NowPlayingTest project is to:

1. **Complete Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the migration from expo-av to react-native-track-player, including:
   - Migration plan with implementation phases
   - Technical notes and learnings
   - Developer setup instructions
   - Implementation considerations

2. **Repository Setup**: Set up a GitHub repository to store the project and documentation, making it accessible for development on multiple computers.

3. **Prepare for Migration Implementation**: Organize the codebase and documentation to facilitate the actual implementation of the migration in the BalearicFmRadio app.

## Recent Changes

1. **Documentation Creation**:
   - Created READ_ME_FIRST.md as an entry point to all documentation
   - Developed MIGRATION_PLAN.md with detailed implementation phases
   - Created MIGRATION_NOTES.md with important context and considerations
   - Wrote MEDIA_PLAYER_LEARNINGS.md with technical implementation details
   - Created README_TRACK_PLAYER.md with project overview
   - Developed REQUIRED_DEVELOPER_SETUP.md with environment setup instructions

2. **Repository Management**:
   - Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/batsonjay/NowPlayingTest
   - Committed all documentation files
   - Set up remote origin
   - Pushed changes to GitHub

3. **Memory Bank Setup**:
   - Created memory-bank directory
   - Started populating core Memory Bank files

## Active Decisions

1. **Hybrid Naming Approach**: Decided to use a hybrid naming approach for the migration:
   - New namespace with similar function names
   - Compatibility layer for backward compatibility
   - Deprecation markers for old functions

2. **File Organization Strategy**: Decided on a modular file structure:
   ```
   utils/
     trackPlayer/
       index.ts                  // Re-exports everything for easy imports
       setup.ts                  // Player setup and initialization
       metadata.ts               // Metadata fetching and handling
       playback.ts               // Core playback functions
       queue.ts                  // Queue management
       types.ts                  // Shared type definitions
       events.ts                 // Event handling
       service.ts                // Playback service implementation
     
   context/
     TrackPlayerContext/
       index.tsx                 // Main context and provider
       hooks.ts                  // Custom hooks for accessing player features
       state.ts                  // State management
       compatibility.tsx         // Compatibility layer
   ```

3. **Queue Implementation**: Decided on a hybrid approach for queue management:
   - Use TrackPlayer's native queue for technical aspects
   - Maintain a lightweight UI queue for visual feedback
   - Preserve the user experience while simplifying the implementation

4. **Metadata Handling**: Decided to maintain the existing metadata structure:
   - For live streams: Artist name goes in title field, song title in description
   - For podcasts: Standard title/artist/description mapping

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**:
   - Finish creating and populating all Memory Bank files
   - Commit and push Memory Bank to GitHub

2. **Prepare for Implementation**:
   - Review the migration plan and notes
   - Set up development environment on the other computer
   - Clone the repository and install dependencies

3. **Begin Implementation**:
   - Start with Phase 1: Add TrackPlayer Dependencies
   - Follow the implementation phases outlined in MIGRATION_PLAN.md
   - Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding

4. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test live stream playback
   - Test podcast playback
   - Test background playback
   - Test edge cases

## Current Challenges

1. **Maintaining Backward Compatibility**: Ensuring the migration doesn't break existing functionality.

2. **Preserving User Experience**: Maintaining the same user experience while changing the underlying implementation.

3. **Handling Metadata Differences**: Ensuring metadata is correctly displayed in the Now Playing widget.

4. **Development Environment Setup**: Setting up the development environment on a new computer.
